===================

This is a simple biquad filter class that enables live digital filtering on real-time devices and microcontrollers or signal processing on all other computer devices.

The file main.cpp contains an application example.

Please refer to [my blog post](https://tomlankhorst.nl/filter-controller-cpp-implementation/) for more details on the subject and application.
